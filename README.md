# Noise-Cancellation-App
Noise-Cancellation-App is a deep learning–based audio processing application built using TensorFlow that removes background noise from audio signals. It leverages neural networks to distinguish between noise and clean speech, enabling real-time or batch audio denoising for enhanced clarity in recordings, calls, and media files.
